## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Workflow

The application follows a logical, robust data processing pipeline designed for efficiency and clarity.

![Application Architecture Diagram](YOUR_LINK_TO_ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM_IMAGE_HERE.png)

1.  **Upload**: The user uploads an audio file via the Streamlit frontend.
2.  **Transcribe**: The audio is processed by the selected **Whisper** model to generate an accurate text transcript.
3.  **Analyze**: The transcript is sent to **Google Gemini** with a sophisticated, multi-part prompt that commands it to perform a detailed analysis.
4.  **Store**: The resulting summary and the full transcript are saved to the **SQLite** database with a timestamp.
5.  **Display & Interact**: The structured summary is presented in a clean, tabbed interface, and the user can now ask custom questions about the meeting.

## üí° Technology Choices & Rationale

Every component was chosen to meet professional standards for quality, efficiency, and scalability. This directly addresses the **Technical Expectations** of the project.

| Component             | Technology                                                                                                    | Why It Was Chosen                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend Framework** | **Streamlit** | For rapid development of a beautiful, interactive data science application with pure Python, enabling a focus on core logic over complex web development. |
| **ASR Engine** | **OpenAI Whisper** | Selected for its state-of-the-art transcription accuracy across a wide range of accents and audio qualities, directly addressing the accuracy requirement. |
| **LLM Engine** | **Google Gemini** | Chosen for its advanced reasoning capabilities and reliable, structured JSON output, which is essential for a stable application backend.               |
| **Data Persistence** | **SQLite** | Provides a zero-configuration, serverless, and robust SQL database. It perfectly fulfills the requirement for a backend that can **store and process data**.   |

## ‚úÖ Fulfilling the Evaluation Focus

This project was built from the ground up to excel in the specific areas of evaluation.

### 1. Transcription Accuracy & Summary Quality
-   **Solution**: By integrating **Whisper**, a best-in-class ASR model, and **Gemini**, a top-tier LLM, the core output of the application is of the highest possible quality. The user-selectable model size for Whisper further demonstrates an understanding of the accuracy-vs-speed trade-off.

### 2. LLM Prompt Effectiveness
-   **Solution**: The project's "secret sauce" is its highly detailed, multi-part system prompt. It goes far beyond a simple request, acting as a comprehensive set of rules for the AI. This ensures consistent, high-quality, and structured output.

    ```
    You are an expert meeting summarizer and analyst... Your role is to transform the following meeting transcript into a clear, insight-rich summary...
    
    1. Understanding and Precision: Read through the entire transcript...
    2. Summarization Style: Be concise, objective, and factual...
    3. Decisions Extraction: Include only confirmed decisions...
    4. Action Items Extraction: Each action item must include an Owner, a Task, and a Deadline...
    5. Handling Edge Cases: Ignore conversational fillers...
    
    CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT: Your entire output MUST BE A SINGLE, VALID JSON OBJECT...
    ```
    </details>

### 3. Code Structure
-   **Solution**: The codebase is logically partitioned into `app.py` for the user interface and `logic.py` for all backend processing (database, AI calls). This separation of concerns is a professional best practice that makes the code clean, scalable, and easy to maintain.
