Thank you very much. This is the Armour Springfield meeting agenda for August 12, 2025, a committee of a whole, starting at 1pm exactly. I'm Mayor Patrick Terrien, all council is present and that will be to my right in descending order, Deputy Mayor Glenn Fuel, Councillor Kaczynski, Miller and Warren. This is in order so we'll go to the approval of the agenda there. Can I get a mover and a seconder for that please? Kaczynski and Fuel. Any additions or approval of the agenda and the concerns? I see none. And if I can get a show hands approval of the agenda. Sorry, Chris, you want me to do some? I just was going to mention that we, I'd like to remove development agreement discussion from closed meeting. Okay. We all got an email with regards to that. Any concerns from council? Nice and I see none. Can I just get a show hands for approval of the agenda please? As unanimous and as carried. Approval of the minutes, a mover and a seconder for that please. Terrien and Warren. Any additions or concerns with regards to approval of the minutes for July 8th of 2025? Then I see none. The show hands, those in support. Unanimous and so carried. That's a cell phone. That's pizza right there. We'll go to the board of revisions 6.1. I'll hand that off to our CEO. So the board of revision is booked for Thursday November 13th. This year to hear appeals for 2026 assessments. We do have the chair of the board has agreed to serve again pending council's resolution. We also need two council members to sit on the board or we need direction from council to find alternate members if that's what you'd like to see this year instead of council sitting on the board. So just need some time to gather names and make contacts if that's the direction this year. What is your direction to council just another two members on there? It'll save us some money there. Not considerable amount of money, but is there two volunteers that we want to put their hands up for the board of revisions? Councilor Kaczynski. And councilor Warren. But we also have the option of having somebody else there. So if as long as you're aware of that, then we'll put your names forward. So that'll be councilors Kaczynski and Warren. Thank you for stepping up there, guys. Then we'll go to the approach by law 6.2. Good afternoon, council. So we've got the approach by law back in front of you. And we have after the last meeting, there were some revisions we needed to do regarding mostly offenses and penalties. So starting on page 9, we revamped the 9.1 or part 9 of offenses. So we've got a lot of line in there in the types of offenses. If you look into number 10, we're in the notice of contravention and orders to remedy. So what we did is we took out the actual penalties and fines. The cost of them, those are actually covered under the enforcement by law. And with that, we did look at the minimums of maximums. I think that was a concern from council before being that they might have been only too stringent. So I believe the minimums are 250 to a maximum of 1000. But then there's other areas that depend on the severity of the offense, if that was the case, there's other areas of which we could take different lines of remedy or penalty so such as highway traffic act as this is part of the within the municipal right away. So we made those changes. Other than that, I don't believe there was any additional changes or comments from the last meeting. So if you have an eye, look at it further questions or comments on it that let us know. I looked at it there and it addressed the our concerns there. I forget which Councillor was there was a few Councillors that were addressing the fact the cost and so on like that. But that's just for me and the other comments from council at all. I just stayed up good with it. Thanks. Well, it was a little while coming to be nice to put a check mark on this next was a while so. Okay. I see there's no questions. And thank you very much. Blamed for that. Then we'll go to 6.3 and that's the Springfield Police Service update. I'll refer to our CEO. So as council is aware as of August 5th of this year, the Springfield Police Service office has been closed. And that's due to the fact that both of our remaining employees, Scott and Jesse have since moved on to the RCMP. And of course we wish them well, but that does leave us with no staff within the department right now. So we did put a notice out on to our social media and website just advising that the office is closed to the public at this time. We provided the relevant non emergency and emergency numbers that people can call. Obviously, the RCMP are still active and considered the primary police service in the municipality. So in the event of an emergency, you still call 911 for police fire ambulance. So we've provided that update to the public. At this time, we've removed all job postings from the website and any sites that we had posted at the time that the department was going to consist of a chief and two constables. So at this time, we're not actively pursuing those postings right now. Just so council has an opportunity to kind of discuss if there's any changes that want to be made. And that's the last time as to do it before there's people in those roles again. So that's the update. I know we've been getting some comments on social media that people wanted more information. So that is the update that we have at this time. Thank you very much. I guess I'll start off and then we can go into sending order here or whoever wants to put up their hands. That's fine. The SPS is not out of service. It's just in limbo until we have determined our next move and council here. So there's a criteria for dismantling a police department and there's three different categories of police service. And I believe Springfield Police Service was category number one. They had full CPEC access, but they were secondited to the RCP. Essentially once they're secondited to the RCP, they run a direction of the RCP and there always has to be a distance between the RMs or anybody that can possibly influence a police service that should never happen in a democratic society. The cost for the SPS services is three quarters of a million dollars roughly. Police cars are huge. Taholes are 135 car. That's not to include the maintenance and so on like that. They're very hard on vehicles there. So the two police services is not a functional way of conducting policing in the RMS Springfield. I've been noted that in my campaign there. I've had many discussions with I do have coffee with people in the Oak Bank at Tim Horton's there often and then doodled and I've had coffees there in Innolla. The main thing that I found in my campaigning three years ago why are we having police two police services and that is still the discussion having coffee with mainly retired people in the RMS. So two police services it's a great idea to have extra police for the RSMP but the RSMP have a certain level of training and having other police officers in the same room and so on like that. It's not everybody gets along I would say so but I have intimate experience with this because I was in charge of ESA Impal detachment for the second corporal that was in there for the transition there and I had ESA Impal police that were hired on by the RSMP. So I know what at both sides literally both sides of the desk as the mayor and as an attachment commander. And I can say with experience that the idea of having two different services there is not an ideal way of doing things. The police work is done don't get me wrong it's the RSMP that has control with the SACOMMENT. We lost our by-loves there's once the SACOMMENT agreement was in there essentially we were at the control of the RSMP there to allow our members to do some of their due diligence and their jobs. The RSMP is thin there's no doubt about that there but there are world class police service there I'm a bit biased there but we have to look at the cohesiveness and the cost to taxpayers. Cost of taxpayers is huge and it's only going to go up higher and higher liabilities are on the Springfield police. People the taxpayers there of 17,000 will mean well the RSMP to liability is an act of national police force so it's on the people of Canada all insurance aside there but that's exactly what is liabilities are huge especially in the job as a police men or a police woman. So that said I the CSO program which is a program community safety officer I think is an ideal position there that we should look at going forward but this is a decision of council. We have to have interaction with the our stakeholders or the taxpayers in the Army Springfield because we are getting rid of a category one police service there and there is certain criteria to adhere to the minister has to be proving this there and we have to get the consensus from the citizens of the Army Springfield to see what they would like. And I have had many discussions with people they phone lots of phone calls with regards to this and the demographics I say it is the elderly demographics. So neither side I'm not a statistician there but that's what I notice is that it's a very most people that phone me that I'd say it's a vast majority do not need the the Springfield police service. It's funny because they don't want to be paying the extra taxes. I mean well other people say that they want the police service around and they want to be safe and see the police around. So that's what we have to we have to get in touch with our people in the Army Springfield. I guess that's about it so I can get an idea that I'm steering towards the fact that we should look at what our requirements are and listen to the people that aside we have to look at the fiscal responsibilities there of saving three quarters of a million dollars it's an extremely high amount of money. I'll refer to Deputy Mayor he had his hand up. Yes thank you Mayor. I'd just like to add a little more to that discussion is that you know I put a lot of thought to this and I believe going forward you know we should again abide by what the Justice Minister says we need to do and I think part of that process is doing public open houses and then kind of kind of bringing it all together once we've done whatever needs to be done. Having said that is with the going forward I would put a cross council to think about doing a referendum at the next voting period. I think it's important that we open it up to the public to get a full vote on this it's important it's part of our safety. I don't disagree that we have a con agreement I think again that again more police officers better than less I think right now at this time we we will have less in this area and I just believe that again do it properly let the people speak and bring it forward at election time thank you. I guess Deputy Mayor there the one thing I could I could get from that is that that's not till October we have to we'd have to contract a police or somebody to do our bylaws in that in that meantime our city don't do bylaws I guess yeah they don't we don't we don't the R.C.P. I said we it's not but the R.C.P. doesn't do bylaws so we'll have to hire somebody for that that one year interval until that time I guess that's the only weakness I see in that but I do like the idea the referendum specifically for the one thing here this this would cover all known people in the armors springfield so I think that's that's a point of discussion Councillor Kaczynski. Thank you Mayor I would ask question first what we're going to do with the police board are we going to get rid of police board to because do we paying them some members not the council member but the other members getting a renumerated for the time spent on the political meeting. Well I guess I'll answer that so they're only paid when they meet right now they have two more meetings scheduled for the year that they're required to have so I'll be reaching out to the acting police board chair to see what that looks like for the September and I think December meetings but right now they're still in place until until notices given that they're no longer required. So what they're going to be discussing if we don't have police? Well I would hope that council and the police board will work together to try to see what kind of open houses what information we want to put out to educate the public on the different options that this you know service could look like. And I think that the and the job should be done by the council not the police board because they're it number police so they have nothing to police anymore. But decision that my suggestion. Secondly I would say that when I was campaigning a lot of people said get rid of the police because we don't need that being tax double by you know federal government that paying for the RSMP and then we were taxing people to to provide the police in our community. So if we probably don't have a regular springfield police then we probably going to bring more RCMP officer and you know and probably maybe they we don't have to have another expense. I have meaning yesterday with the people in the industrial area and I said that we don't have no more police. I said so what you guys going to do? How are we going to protect our area? He said the crime is unbelievable in that area. They have to remove gas tanks from the vehicles so people don't drill the holes in the gas tanks and drain their gas. And those are brand new vehicles. So they have 15 vehicles and they have to remove the gas tanks from that. So we have to think as a council what are we going to do and help to those people? We're going to hire a private security to cruise in that area so prevent the crime happening in that area. We have to do something and something quickly. And now the advice guys all that we have to find the solution for that area. I even suggest to the business owners like hire your own security because they're going to call us then you have to pay the insurance charges that you're going to have. So if all the businesses get together so we probably have to have meaning with the area and suggested to them that you know in the meantime if we don't have police service here and doesn't look like we probably going to have. So we have to talk with RCMP, get more members here and suggest some find some solution to protect that industrial area and protect our citizens here too. And we can probably don't hire anybody. There are companies that you can hire them on the basis as you need them because I don't know what work load they're going to have if we have full time job for the by-law officer. We don't want them to just keep cruising and then you know an area we just want to know that is going to solve the problems for us if problem arise. Thank you. I, we're never going to solve the problem to be honest with you. It's how do you mitigate the problem is the best way to do that. Our, the thinness of the RCMP is not an issue for us in my opinion there. When I ran my detachment if I was low I went out and I always had somebody for over time. That wasn't an issue there. Sometimes it's cheaper to bring in guys and over time you know, fiscally that way but you never, you never run short. You have a minimum compliment. You must have, you must adhere to there and I'd say some detachment are saving money by not adhering to that. That was never an issue with me. I always brought in extra people. As for the industrial area, our community service officers we could task them with coming up with a plan there. We've been doing this job for three years now and I know how many times that we had plans and I am the first most critical person when I, when I, before I got into this job here but they have another study going on to have another analysis going on and then it just lies in the back and it's in another corner of some, some local provincial or federal government here. We have to address it there but a long term address of the problem is a situational problem for the industrial park but it's also a problem around the city of Winnipeg. It's everywhere. Crime is, you know, maybe statistically it says that it's down there but I've never been a big firm believer in statistics there. You can run them numbers to find whatever you want it to save it. I think our CSO officers can do a good job with regards to addressing. They're not just going to be out there. CSO officers just to, you know, just do traffic tickets and so on like that. They're there to look at a problem, address it, give them a mandate. This is your task. Figure out what we can do with regards to the industrial park. They're under our control where we ask them, this is your file, there's a problem with Elm and Teak Drive. It's a lot of people going to the stop signs there, go out there and, you know, I don't want them to be writing tickets for everybody there. They got to use their common sense. So I think a CSO will be able to address that as well. Mayor, can you please explain to the resident what CSO means? Okay. It's community safety officers. So it's going to be the new thing that they're going to hear about for quite some, for the next little while. CSO is a community safety officer. They're not armed. They are, I guess they'll be in some kind of a uniform there. They could use our police cars that we have that are in storage now for this Springfield Police Service there. And they're going to have, you know, if we decide that's what they're going to use, if they could always use public works and old trucker or something like that. I'd sure like to see them do weights and measures there, get them trained where they can keep these big trucks off of our roads if they stop them, put them on the mobile scales and if they're over, then we'll write them a ticket to take the vehicles away and it won't take long if we start bumping these guys a few times. Word gets around that the Springfield has our own community safety officers that are weights and measures are trained and those tickets are quite size bold. They'll, they'll adhere pretty darn quick. Councillor Miller. Thank you, Mayor. First off, I know this isn't the time to debate and to discuss this in great detail. So I'll leave it for that opportunity, but I do want to say it's kind of an unfortunate position we're in. And, you know, as Councillor Kaczynski suggested many moons ago that we should have addressed this and I know we're starting to address it now, but we'll have to. Going forward, I want to say a special thank you to the contributors and the volunteers on the, on the obviously the Springfield police board. They dedicated their time, their expertise and obviously their insight on this and it's probably caught them by some level of surprise as well. So again, appreciation to, to all those who have dedicated the time and effort on that because the policing is, is a very important and tickled part of their community. I share some of the conviction of the mayor and that's when I also supported his candidacy, I guess, so to speak, for, for running because I believe we need to look at community safety officers, but again, that debate will come in due course. I'm also very thrilled that Councillor Fuel is taking part of the script out of Councillor Kaczynski in my playbook and that is obviously going with a referendum. A referendum on sale was we did as an end of, as a separate entity showed that 90% of the population of our community did not want sale silica, broken it first nation did a referendum. You saw that they shelved that concept as well. Referendums are very important and tickled parts of engaging with the community and I'm very thrilled again that Councillor Fuel now embraces that point of view when maybe you didn't with the sale, but having said that, we can always change and do things better, so absolutely I've heard from residents throughout my ward and actually throughout our community in the last couple of weeks who have absolutely given me their point of view on what should happen with policing. But if our M can go further with a survey or use website, we use a referendum, whether that's before the next election or part of that election, I think it's important we need to really engage with the public and see what they want. $750,000 per year plus is not something we could just continue to fund if there's not a will and a need. I share Councillor Kaczynski's concern that crime may increase, but how do we know? I think the mayor is in a better position to respond to that. I was interviewed by the carol on this week as some of you were as well and one of the questions was how do I think crime will unfold in the next weeks to come? It's kind of an uncertainty. I'm obviously optimistic to say that the RCMP will backfill as the mayor has indicated perhaps add some additional overtime or whatever staffing they require, but I'm certainly not looking that there's going to be a free for all within our community, whether it be any element of crime. So I just have to be positive and very optimistic that we're going to deal with this sooner than later because obviously there's a lot of people who are affected here and including all the people in our community. So I'll leave the debate for a later opportunity. Thank you. Thank you. Councillor Warren. Thank you, Mayor. I echo that we have a great concern here without our SPS. I've got to say, Springfields, I find it has always been the stepping stone to the RCMP. And congratulations to those gentlemen that are serving in our area for the RCMP now. When we talk about CSOs, let's not get ahead of ourselves quite yet. We do need bylaw enforcement. We do know that we do have to talk to Manitoba Justice and we have to follow what the guidelines are. We can't just just remember a police just because we don't want it. There are rules to follow. When it comes to CSOs, let me remind you that before the succumbent agreement, our police officers were going out there like bylaw officers doing community service without radio communication. So a CSO without going to pull somebody over doing a traffic stop without any kind of radio or any kind of backup for anybody to know where they are is also dangerous. So there's a lot of things to think about here before we can move forward. We need to talk to Manitoba Justice. So just food for thought. Thanks. Thank you. I know Councillor Warren thinks for that. But one criteria that I would strongly suggest that if we go with the CSO and that's just if and you're quite right, there's other options there. But CSO is out there. They won't be doing traffic stops. In my opinion, that would be ludicrous there without having a firearm and starting chases. It's a very, very high risk. So that would be one thing that I would strongly suggest we're not there yet, but no traffic stops. They'll have a radio contact there for whatever they're doing or cell phones there. But for stopping somebody on the side of the road, that just in my opinion, that would never happen. And I want to assure the public here that the RSMP is our police service. They always have been and they always will be. Well, it shouldn't say always will be, but at this point here, the RSMP is the dedicated primary police force in the province of Manitoba across Canada. So they're here still now. So I don't want anybody to go home and have fear. There's no fear of the RSMP of one of our members actually that was from the Strength Phil Police Services is still in our area. I don't want to say what detachment there, but it's not rocket science there. So we've actually lost two SPS, but we've only really lost one one that's not in our area anymore. So that said, like Councillor Miller said, we have a lot to discuss with regards to this, but I don't want people to be fearing. Oh, my God, there's no RSMP, there's no police. We have that. They have the job well under control. I think we discussed that quite in length for the committee of a whole. Then at this point here, I'm prepared to go to the close meeting there. Can I get a mover in a seconder for a close meeting, please? Councillor Kaczynski and Warren. I'm going to show hands for a close meeting, unanimous and is carried. We'll go to close meeting at exactly 131 P.M. Thank you. We are coming out of our close meeting at 2.11 P.M. If I get a mover in a seconder to come out of the close meeting, please. Terry and then Kaczynski. Unless there's any questions from council, I see none. I'm prepared to adjourn and we'll adjourn a meeting at 2.12 P.M. Thank you very much. What?
